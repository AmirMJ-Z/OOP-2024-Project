> **Project Description**

***City Wars; Tokyo Region*** is a CCG Turn-Based Game designed and developed by an independant game development company called ***Mojo Bones Ltd*** located in the U.K which has been published in August 2022.

In this project we are trying to make our own version of the game using the power of **Object Oriented Programming** and ***Java*** as one of the most frequently used Object Oriented Programming languages.

As for the graphics we will use ***JavaFX*** as a software platform designed to deliver desktop applications.

The UML Design Diagram of the Classes, Methods and Attributes used are also available at the end of this document.
